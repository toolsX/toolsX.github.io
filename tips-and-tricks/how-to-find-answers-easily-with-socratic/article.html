        <h2>Tired of online learning?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Distance learning, or <strong>online learning</strong> has been a
          round for a while, and many students faced new challenges that were'nt
          there before, like diffuculty in learning online because of poor
          internet connections, or you may have a teacher or instructer who
          themselves not knowing how to full engage with sudents online, or
          maybe the education system for the school university for managing
          online learning is poor.
          <br />
          <br />
          You may have a question that you don't fully understand, and need the
          <strong>solution or answer</strong> for instantly, and sometimes you
          may need explanation for the question too espacially when you are
          studying from home and need help when you really can't go outside to
          get help.
          <br />

          Well don't worry that much now about all these problems now, i will be
          showing you a simple and easy method on how to get
          <strong>instant explanations and solutions for free</strong> and
          easily and simple. <br /><br />
          Below i will be talking about an app you can download on your smart
          phone, iOS or android
        </p>

        <br /><br />
        <h2>So how do i get all of this?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          So you found this blog after searching on google for a solid 10
          minutes(maybe?), searching for a working method that is simple and
          easy to access and use everytime, and most importantly, its
          <strong>FREE</strong>, who doesn't like free stuff, i will be showing
          you the method right now. <br /><br />
          The app used to do all this is called
          <a href="https://socratic.org" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255)"
            >Socratic by Google</a
          >, its an app that google bought and is currently working on, it's the
          app that does all the things mentioned earlier, from finding detailed
          explanations for the questions topic on websites or on youtube, to
          finding answers and solutions for your questions, there are benifits
          to this app that not all apps that are for the same purpose have, they
          are the following:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255)">Easy to use</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The most important thing for an app to have is the easability to use
          so you can use it struggle free,
          <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255)">Socratic</span> is very easy to
          use, it doens't require a tech genius to navigate and use, it has a
          clear UI, so that everyone can pickup and start using it to find what
          they need with no hastle.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 style="color: rgb(153, 0, 255)">Works for all subjects</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Socratic is universal, it works for all the subjects you could image,
          from Science, Math, Literature, Social Studies, Physics, and so much
          more! <br />
          <br />
          So you won't have to download multiple apps, each app works for a
          different subject, no, socratic is universal and works for every thing
          you need, so you will get detailed explanations wether its Calculus or
          wether its Literature.
        </p>
